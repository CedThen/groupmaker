# Groupmaker
Groupmaker is a simple way to quickly split up your party into groups for any occasion. 

No more counting off in a circle, no more awkward scenarios choosing your best friend last.

Direct everyone to groupmaker on their phone, then select the number of groups and the size of each group, and hit split! 
Groupmaker will automatically divide the party into evenly sized groups, and will then display on each phone their entire group.
